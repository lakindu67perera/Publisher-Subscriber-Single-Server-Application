Let's create a client-server socket application in Python. We'll follow these steps:

Server:

Listen on a specified port.
Accept connections from clients.
Display messages received from clients.
Run indefinitely until manually stopped.
Handle multiple concurrent client connections using threads.

Client:

Connect to the server using the provided IP and port.
Send messages typed in the CLI to the server.
Terminate the connection when the keyword "terminate" is typed.
If the role is Publisher, send messages to the server.
If the role is Subscriber, receive and display messages from the server.
Accept a fourth command line argument to specify the role (Publisher or Subscriber) (topic_A or topic_B).

To run:

server: python server.py <port>
client: python client.py <local ip address> <port> <role> <topic>
